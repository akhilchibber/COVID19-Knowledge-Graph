## Overview
The COVID-19 Knowledge Graph Project focuses on building a biomedical knowledge graph to uncover relationships between chemicals, genes, and diseases in the context of COVID-19. Using research articles and datasets like BioSNAP, the project extracts entity relationships (e.g., gene-disease, chemical-disease) from biomedical texts.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle: [COVID-19 Knowledge Graph Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge).

## Getting Started
To get started with this project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed and running.
3. Install the required dependencies.
4. Download the "COVID-19 Knowledge Graph Dataset" and place it in the designated directory.
5. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook "COVID19-Knowledge-Graph.ipynb" to train and evaluate the model.
